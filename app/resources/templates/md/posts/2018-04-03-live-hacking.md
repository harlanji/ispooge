"in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few." -Suzuki Roshen

    Shoshin
    Shoshin is a word from Zen Buddhism meaning "beginner's mind." It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would. The term is especially used in the study of Zen Buddhism and Japanese martial arts.
