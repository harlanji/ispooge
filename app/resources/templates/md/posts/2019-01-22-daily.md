Hey. First time doing a podcast with iSpooge Live.

It's a middle ground between tweet storming and vlogging.

It's about 5 minutes long, using my fancy mic.

I got a DC car charger for the laptop, allowing me to finally work 
in peace and quiet, relatively uninturrupted.

Been feeling under the weather, resting up.
