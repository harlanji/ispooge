FreshSpooge is a solution for video websites and apps.



## For live streamers

FreshSpooge allows you to stream low latency to your viewers without commercial or other inturruption. Video chunks 
are written to the file system and served directly to your audience, via CDN if one is configured, using the industry-accepted 
techniques.

## For YouTube channels

Using our scripts to import videos and playlists, you can quickly create a backup of your channel that's under your control. You 
can use it to demo videos offline and as a safe store for the master copies of your video. SD cards make for easy IT operations 
like backup.

## For software engineers

If you've ever wanted to create a livecoding environment but haven't wanted to stream your video through external 
networks, now is your chance. Using as little as a RasPi you can create a streaming video solution for your organization,
and make it public if you like. Third party login integration is simple to add to our boilerplate system.

## For families

IT operations are cumbersome and sometimes we store sensitive information. Worse, sometimes our computer 
illiterate family members store valuable information and it is lost during a confusing click through process.
